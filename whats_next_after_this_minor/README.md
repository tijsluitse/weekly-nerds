## Whats next after this minor?

The minor Everything Web was very intensive but most of all very instructive. Before starting this minor I thought that I knew the web, but no. I've learned so much about new techniques, about structuring code properly, about working hard and overcome difficult problems. That I can say I have something to say about the web with a solid opinion. But what's next? These courses were the last CMD related courses, next year I'm going to do a internship (hopefully at Mediamonks or Bravoure) and after my final graduation project, CMD is gone. The four years of CMD flew by with a lot of fun and hard work. 

### Why Everything Web?

When looking at the minors I could choose from last year, I immediately wanted to do Everything Web. My last half year of courses! I want to gain all possible knowledge when I'm still here. And that was a great choice. If you like front-end- design or development, this is your minor, if you like backend-development, this is your minor, even if you are a visual interface designer, this is your minor. You knowledge about the web grows enormously. A big compliment to all professors making this minor possible. 

### Work hard, play hard

It starts with building a web application from scratch, something I never done before. You learn new stuff about CSS I've never seen before. Even when I thought I knew CSS 95%. That's one of the nice things I've learned about the web, it is such a dynamic platform where everything changes, every week new stuff is available. And this was just the kickoff. After this first four weeks it only became more interesting, from weird browsers and how websites behave to working with small motherboards which can send sensor data to a server. Working with Meteor and creating a real time web application was also very instructive. From that point I began to feel that there is so much ahead of me in my career as a front-end developer. 

### How to challenge myself

But what does my career looks like? Where am I going to work? Do I want to work in a big web related company with people who inspire me and are way ahead of me? Or do I want to start my own business and develop web applications and websites for all kind of different clients. Something I need and I certainly want to find out in my next year as an intern. 

At the final master exercise of this minor I really felt strong in a small team, building a web application for the [N-festival](https://nfest.lisaklein.nl). In only 5 weeks we created a fully working app in (mostly) native Javascript. Before this minor I didn't even knew that was possible. So when listening to my heart I want to do this, working in small teams, building different kind of apps and websites. Start my own business and gathering good people around me. But this minor also showed me my interest in getting triggered to do and learn new stuff. How can you challenge yourself to go to workshops or readings about new web technologies? Is that even possible when you can choose between that or finishing a website to earn money. I think that's a very hard decision I need to make. I think it's almost impossible to say "O no, sorry I have a workshop tonight so I can't finish my code which we need to present to the client tomorrow". Work will always be more important than a workshop. But I want to learn, I want to grow and develop my skills. 

When working at a existing company with senior developers around me, you always be inspired or motivated in some kind of way. Even though you are busy with your own stuff, you have lunch with colleagues, you talk to your colleagues also if they work on a totally different task. It may even be possible that I find some sort of expertise which I never knew existed. If I look at my curiosity, a place like this looks maybe more promising. Therefore, I would go for my internship in a big company to see how I feel in such an environment. I already have my own business so if I don't like it, I expand that. I have enough people around me to work with, that's not the point. But getting inspired by new things is something I need in my career, in a web related career. 

### Conclusion

I know this is a quest that I can only do by myself. I hope next year is going to bring me some clarity in how I want to develop myself over the next years. Money is not my main concern, I want to grow in knowledge and get inspired by people who are ahead of me. But its going to be one of these two options, my heart says that I want to start my own business but my head says that I want to learn more, and I think that's only possible by working in a company. But we shall see how next year is going and hopefully I can write a paper with a good view in the future.
